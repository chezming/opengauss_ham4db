  <h1>Ham4db</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome! Ham4db is your replication visualization and management tool.
  </p>
  <div id="clustersFound" class="hiddenMessage">
    <p>
      <i>Ham4db</i> is familiar with <code id="numClusters"></code> replication cluster(s) at this moment. Click "Clusters" on top navigation bar too see them. If you have more replication clusters you wish to visualize and manage, please let <i>ham4db</i>      know about them by going to the <a href="{{.prefix}}/web/discover">discovery page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ham4db</i> is a multi-tiered application. It executes as a command line tool - you can Move replicas around the topology and do most other stuff. It also serves as Web API. In fact, there is little to the web interface you're using right
      now - it's mostly client cosmetics; all operations in this web interface are based on web API calls.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="noClustersFound" class="hiddenMessage">
    <p>
      It seems like this is your initial installation of <i>ham4db</i>: there are no known clusters at this stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your next task is to let <i>ham4db</i> know about your replication topologies. Pick one server from each topology (this could be either master or replica). <i>Ham4db</i> will attempt to connect to such a server, and auto-discover the entire
      replication tree by recursively crawling the server's master and replicas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once discovered (and allow for a few minutes for complete replication graph detection), you will be able to easily change your topology via drag & drop, start & stop your replicas, start/end maintenance modes and get quick insight into replication problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure your configuration file has the proper credentials for accessing all those remote MySQL servers. You will need the <code>SUPER</code> and <code>PROCESS</code> privileges on any node you wish to be able to discover. Make sure to run the
      following on masters of your topologies; fill in your own host name (limit <code>'%'</code> to a specific host), user and password:
      <pre>
GRANT SUPER, PROCESS ON *.* TO 'ham4db'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';
</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="{{.prefix}}/web/discover">Start discovery now</a>
    </p>
  </div>
